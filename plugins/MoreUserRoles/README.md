# More User Roles

## Description

This plugin adds two new user roles to Omeka sites and lightly modifies the admin user forms.

## User Roles

- **Authors** inherit the rights of Contributors but are able to publish their own items.
- **Editors** inherit the rights of Authors but are able to edit and delete items and files created by other users and make any items public and/or featured.

## Form Modifications

- Sorts user roles by "power" – from least to most – in the user admin dropdowns
- Annotates which user roles are created by the plugin
- Adds a link to plugin documentation on Github.

## Uninstalling the Plugin

When the plugin is uninstalled, Author and Editor users are demoted to the Contributor role.
