# Curatescape Admin Helper

An Omeka plugin that installs the Curatescape Story item type and related fields, adds customization options for the admin dashboard, and more.

## Usage

Installing the plugin automatically adds a new item type called "Curatescape Story" as well as the following fields:

- Subtitle
- Lede
- Story
- Sponsor
- Factoid
- Related Resources
- Official Website
- Street Address
- Access Information

## Options

After installation, you may disable or remove the plugin if you like, but keeping it installed will give you access to the following options, which may be helpful for managing your Curatescape site:

- Display file statistics on the dashboard (i.e. count of files by media type)
- Display the Curatescape Resources widget on the dashboard (links to useful resources)
- Display the Curatescape Components widget on the dashboard (notes on missing plugins and other required settings)
- Display Curatescape-related instructions, tips and other notes on the item and file forms
- Display _only_ the main Curatescape-related metadata fields on the item and file forms (other fields are still accessible with a single click)
- Display "Edit" links below each file on item records
- Display Add Input buttons _only_ on fields that are supported by the Curatescape theme.
- Display "Use HTML" checkboxes _only_ on fields that are supported by the Curatescape theme (unsupported fields containing HTML will display an admin-only warning).
- Display an option to batch-convert existing items to the Curatescape Story item type, migrating content from Dublin Core fields to related custom Item Type fields (mainly for one-time use by legacy projects)
