#About the Mobile Historical Project

Mobile Historical is a mobile app platform for iOS & Android, designed to "curate the city" through the use of geo-located historical texts, archival film and images, oral history (and other) audio, and short documentary videos. Built on Omeka, everyone's favorite open source archival CMS, Mobile Historical is designed for small- to medium-sized cultural heritage and educational institutions.

#About This Code

This code is dependant upon the [Omeka CMS](http://omeka.org "Omeka"), and contains a theme and several plugins to run on that platform. 

##Theme

The theme is based on [ClevelandHistorical](http://ClevelandHistorical.org "ClevelandHistorical"), the first iteration of the MobileHistorical project. 

##Plugins

As of version 1.0 there are 5 plugins used to extend or alter Omeka's default functionality.

####Geolocation 
This is a slightly modified version of the [standard Omeka Geolocation](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/Geolocation "Geolocation @ Omeka.org") plugin. It is used to collect and display geodata for each POI.

####ImageTree
Breaks images into faster loading tiles for download to client apps.

####MobileJson
Modifies Omeka's default JSON output functionality.

####TourBuilder
Adds the ability to collect item-based POIs and organize into sequential "tours."

####SendToAdminHeader (optional)
Modifies the content entry process to help clarify the data model used in MobileHistorical v 1.0, which differs significantly from how typical Omeka archives are arranged. 

##Client Apps

The native client applications are not yet available for download.
