#About Curatescape and the Mobile Historical Initiative

Curatescape is the set of tools used in the Mobile Historical initiative, including a set of themes and plugins for the [Omeka CMS](http://omeka.org), and native client applications for Android and iOS devices.

The Mobile Historical initiative is an NEH-funded project aiming to develop best practices in curating landscapes and collections within the intellectual framework of the humanities and social sciencs using low-cost, hosted, and open-source mobile curation and publishing tools.
