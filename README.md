#About Curatescape

Curatescape is the set of tools used in the Mobile Historical initiative, including a set of themes and plugins for the [Omeka CMS](http://omeka.org), and native client applications for Android and iOS devices.

The Mobile Historical initiative is an NEH-funded project aiming to develop best practices for curating physical landscapes and location-based digital collections using low-cost and open-source publishing tools.
