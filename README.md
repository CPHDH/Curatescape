#About Curatescape and the Mobile Historical Initiative

Curatescape is the set of tools used in the Mobile Historical initiative, including a set of themes and plugins for the [Omeka CMS](http://omeka.org), as well as native client applications for Android and iOS devices.

The Mobile Historical initiative represents first steps toward developing best practices toward curating landscapes and collections within the intellectual framework of humanities and social science disciplines. The Mobile Historical initiative seeks to explore the development of low-cost, hosted, and open-source technical solutions to mobile curation and publishing.

#About This Code

The Curatescape ecosystem is dependant upon the [Omeka CMS](http://omeka.org "Omeka"), and contains a theme and several plugins to run on that platform. 

##Theme

The theme is based on [ClevelandHistorical](http://ClevelandHistorical.org "ClevelandHistorical"), the first iteration of the MobileHistorical project. 

##Plugins

As of version 1.0 there are 5 plugins used to extend or alter Omeka's default functionality.

####Geolocation 
This is a slightly modified version of the [standard Omeka Geolocation](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/Geolocation "Geolocation @ Omeka.org") plugin. It is used to collect and display geodata for each POI.

####ImageTree
Breaks images into faster loading tiles for download to client apps.

####MobileJson
Modifies Omeka's default JSON output functionality.

####TourBuilder
Adds the ability to collect item-based POIs and organize into sequential "tours."

####SendToAdminHeader (optional)
Modifies the content entry process to help clarify the data model used in MobileHistorical v 1.0, which differs significantly from how typical Omeka archives are arranged. 

##Client Apps

The native client applications for Android and iOS are not yet available for download.
