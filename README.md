#About Curatescape and the Mobile Historical Initiative

Curatescape is the set of tools used in the Mobile Historical initiative, including a set of themes and plugins for the [Omeka CMS](http://omeka.org), as well as native client applications for Android and iOS devices.

The Mobile Historical initiative represents first steps toward developing best practices toward curating landscapes and collections within the intellectual framework of humanities and social science disciplines. The Mobile Historical initiative seeks to explore the development of low-cost, hosted, and open-source technical solutions to mobile curation and publishing.
